			"DetailedDescription": "This texture has been generated procedurally. This work have been done by Antoine Zanuttini. An algorithm spawn circles with different sizes and no overlapping then for the red channel: calculate the distance inversed and normalized from the circle center, for the green/blue channel: store the direction from the circle center, for the alpha: take random grey value constant for the circle."
